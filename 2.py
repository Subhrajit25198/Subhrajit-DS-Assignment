Algorithm: Arrange Clothes in an Almirah

1. Start
2. Take input n = number of shelves in the almirah
3. Identify clothing categories (e.g., formal, casual, traditional, daily wear, seasonal wear)
4. Count number of items in each category
5. Sort categories based on frequency of use (most frequently used first)
6. Assign lower and easily reachable shelves to frequently used categories
7. Assign upper or less accessible shelves to rarely used or seasonal clothes
8. Within each shelf:
   a. Group clothes by type (shirts, pants, sarees, etc.)
   b. Stack or hang clothes neatly to minimize wasted space
9. Keep similar items together to reduce search time
10. Leave small empty space for future additions if possible
11. End
